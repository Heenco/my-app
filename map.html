            In conclusion, following the inspection of surface work in the readily accessible areas of the property, the overall condition of the building relative to the average condition of similar buildings of approximately the same age that have been reasonably well maintained was considered:<br>
            Average (Consistent with Age)<br>
            <strong>Additional Notes:</strong><br>
            <strong>TIMBER PEST REPORT</strong><br>
            Treatment of Timber Pest Attack is required.<br>No<br>
            In addition to this Report a Subterranean Termite Management Proposal to help manage the risk of future subterranean termite access to buildings and structures is<br>
            Recommended - see Item E2<br>
            Removal of Conditions Conducive to Timber Pest Attack is necessary.<br>
            Yes, as detailed in Section E<br>
            Due to the susceptibility of the property to sustaining Timber Pest Attack the next inspection is recommended<br>
            in 1 Month<br>
            <strong>Additional Notes:</strong><br>
            <strong>SECTION G IMPORTANT NOTES</strong><br>
            <strong>PROPERTY REPORT - IMPORTANT NOTE</strong><br>
            Australian Standard AS4349.0-2007 Inspection of Buildings, Part 0: General Requirements recognises that a property report is not a warranty or an insurance policy against problems developing with the building in the future. Accordingly, a preventative maintenance program should be implemented for the property which includes systematic inspections, detection and prevention of incipient failure. Please contact the Consultant who carried out this inspection for further advice.<br>
            <strong>TIMBER PEST REPORT - RISK MANAGEMENT OPTIONS</strong><br>
            To help protect against financial loss, it is essential that the building owner immediately control or rectify any evidence of destructive timber pest activity or damage identified in this Report. The Client should further investigate any high risk area where access was not gained. It is strongly advised that appropriate steps be taken to remove, rectify or monitor any evidence of conditions conducive to timber pest attack.<br>
            To help minimise the risk of any future loss, the Client should consider whether the following options to further protect their investment against timber pest infestation are appropriate for their circumstances:<br>
            Undertake thorough regular inspections at intervals not exceeding twelve months or more frequent inspections where the risk of timber pest attack is high or the building type is susceptible to attack. To further reduce the risk of subterranean termite attack, implement a management program in accordance with Australian Standard AS 3660. This may include the installation of a monitoring and/or baiting system, or chemical and/or physical barrier. However, AS 3660 stresses that subterranean termites can bridge or breach barrier systems and inspection zones and that thorough regular inspections of the building are necessary.<br>
            If the Client has any queries or concerns regarding this Report, or the Client requires further information on a risk management program, please do not hesitate to contact the person who carried out this Inspection.<br>

            The following lists DO NOT form part of the inspection: ((Electrical, Plumbing, Appliances Inspection, Surveying, Geo-Technical, Air Conditioning, Structural Engineering, Council Compliance, Asbestos (if your house was built after 2003, it is unlikely that it would have any asbestos-containing materials), Fire Alarm/Smoke Alarm technician, Fire Engineer))<br>
            Please note that no council approval checks are carried out during the inspection. We strongly recommend that you ensure any required approvals are in place prior to your purchase.<br>
            A 10-year phased rollout of interconnected photoelectric smoke alarms in Queensland will happen over three specific periods starting 1 January 2017.<br>
            What does this mean for your home?<br>
            To comply with legislation, interconnected photoelectric smoke alarms are required:<br>
            * From 1 January 2017: in all new dwellings and substantially renovated dwellings (this applies to building applications submitted from 1 January 2017).<br>
            * From 1 January 2022: in all domestic dwellings leased and sold.<br>
            * From 1 January 2027: in all other domestic dwellings.<br>
            - Exterior areas where applicable, including behind vegetation, hot water systems, air conditioning units, sheds, stored items and water tanks, have reduced the ability for a precise visual inspection.<br>
            - Please note that testing of dishwashers, washing machines, intercoms and other general appliances do not form part of the inspection.<br>
            - Please note that alarms, security systems and irrigation installations do not form part of the inspection.<br>
            - Doors and windows throughout the property are not key tested during the inspection. We recommend you ensure that all keys are available and function correctly with the seller prior to your purchase.<br>
            - Air conditioning units in locations and water tank pumps could not be tested. We recommend you ensure that all units are fully functional prior to your purchase.<br>
            - Due to the property being vacant at the time of the inspection, an accurate assessment of moisture could not be obtained.<br>
            - Accurate moisture assessment cannot be achieved due to dry weather conditions at the time of the inspection.<br>
            - Ensure all Rainwater Goods (Gutters, Downpipes, Rain harvesting equipments) been cleaned regularly, debris free. (Min two times a year highly advised). Any blockages or clogged system might lead into overflowing and creating conducive conditions to damage Main Building Structures (Timber frame structure, Soffit sheets, internal Ceiling panels & etc.)<br>
