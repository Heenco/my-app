To the Consultant's knowledge the similar building used for comparison was constructed in accordance with\ngenerally accepted timber pest management practices and has since been maintained during all its life not to attract or support timber\npest infestation.\nUnless noted in \"Special Conditions or Instructions\", this Report assumes that the existing use of the building will continue.\nThis Report only records the observations and conclusions of the Consultant about the readily observable state of the property at the\ntime of inspection.

This Report does not include the inspection and assessment of matters outside the scope of the requested inspection and report.\n2. The inspection only covered the Readily Accessible Areas of the Building and Site. The inspection did not include areas which\nwere inaccessible, not readily accessible or obstructed at the time of inspection. Obstructions are defined as any condition or\nphysical limitation which inhibits or prevents inspection and may include - but are not limited to - roofing, fixed ceilings, wall\nlinings, floor coverings, fixtures, fittings, furniture, clothes, stored articles/materials, thermal insulation, sarking, pipe/duct work,\nbuilder's debris, vegetation, pavements or earth.\n3. The detection of drywood termites may be extremely difficult due to the small size of the colonies. No warranty of absence of\nthese termites is given.\n4. European House Borer (Hylotrupes bajulus) attack is difficult to detect in the early stages of infestation as the galleries of boring\nlarvae rarely break through the affected timber surface. No warranty of absence of these borers is given. Regular inspections\nincluding the carrying out of appropriate tests are required to help monitor susceptible timbers.\n5. This is not a structural damage report. Neither is this a warranty as to the absence of Timber Pest Attack.\n6. If the inspection was limited to any particular type(s) of timber pest (e.g. subterranean termites), then this would be the subject of\na Special-Purpose Inspection Report, which is adequately specified.\n7. This Report does not cover or deal with environmental risk assessment or biological risks not associated with Timber Pests (e.g.\ntoxic mould) or occupational, health or safety issues. Such advice may be the subject of a Special-Purpose Inspection Report\nwhich is adequately specified and must be undertaken by an appropriately qualified inspector. The choice of such inspector is a\nmatter for the Client.\n8. This Report has been produced for the use of the Client. The Consultant or their firm or company are not liable for any reliance\nplaced on this report by any third party.\nEXCLUSIONS\nThe Client acknowledges that:\n1. This Report does not deal with any timber pest preventative or treatment measures, or provide costs for the control, rectification\nor prevention of attack by timber pests. However, this additional information or advice may be the subject of a timber pest\nmanagement proposal which is adequately specified.\nPre-Purchase Standard Property & Timber Pest Report © Copyright Report Systems Australia Pty Ltd - amended and reproduced under copyright Licence 1310-c033\nSubmitted by: A1TEAM-001 @ 21:59:59 13/04/2023 Page 6\nSubmission ID: 13060102\nEnvironment friendly, paperless solution by www.formitize.com",

The term 'readily accessible' also includes:\n(a) accessible subfloor areas on a sloping site where the minimum clearance is not less than 150 mm high, provided that the\narea is not more than 2 metres from a point with conforming clearance (i.e. 400 mm high by 600 mm wide); and\n(b) areas at the eaves of accessible roof spaces that are within the consultant's unobstructed line of sight and within arm's length\nfrom a point with conforming clearance (i.e. 600 mm high by 600 mm wide).\n\"Building & Site\" means the inspection of the nominated residence together with relevant features including any car\naccommodation, detached laundry, ablution facilities and garden sheds, retaining walls more than 700 mm high, paths and\ndriveways, steps, fencing, earth, embankments, surface water drainage and stormwater run-off within 30 m of the building, but\nwithin the property boundaries.\nFor the Timber Pest Report, the term \"Building & Site\" is extended to include the main building (or main buildings in the case of a\nbuilding complex) and all timber structures (such as outbuildings, landscaping, retaining walls, fences, bridges, trees and stumps\nwith a diameter greater than 100 mm and timber embedded in soil) and the land within the property boundaries up to a distance\nof 50 metres from the main building(s).\nThe inspection did not include areas, which were inaccessible, not readily accessible or obstructed at the time of inspection. Areas,\nwhich are not normally accessible, were not inspected and include - but not limited to - the interior of a flat roof or beneath a\nsuspended floor filled with earth. Obstructions are defined as any condition or physical limitation which inhibits or prevents inspection\nand may include - but are not limited to - roofing, fixed ceilings, wall linings, floor coverings, fixtures, fittings, furniture, clothes, stored\narticles/materials, thermal insulation, sarking, pipe/duct work, builder's debris, vegetation, pavements or earth.\nAREAS INSPECTED\nThe inspection covered the Readily Accessible Building Interior, Building Exterior, Roof Exterior, Roof Space, The site\nAreas of the property including fences\nAdditional comments:\nSTRATA OR COMPANY TITLE PROPERTIES\nPre-Purchase Standard Property & Timber Pest Report © Copyright Report Systems Australia Pty Ltd - amended and reproduced under copyright Licence 1310-c033\nSubmitted by: A1TEAM-001 @ 21:59:59 13/04/2023 Page 10\nSubmission ID: 13060102\nEnvironment friendly, paperless solution by www.formitize.com",

Accordingly, a preventative maintenance\nprogram should be implemented for the property which includes systematic inspections, detection and prevention of incipient failure.\nPlease contact the Consultant who carried out this inspection for further advice.\nTIMBER PEST REPORT - RISK MANAGEMENT OPTIONS\nTo help protect against financial loss, it is essential that the building owner immediately control or rectify any evidence of destructive\ntimber pest activity or damage identified in this Report. The Client should further investigate any high risk area where access was not\ngained. It is strongly advised that appropriate steps be taken to remove, rectify or monitor any evidence of conditions conducive to\ntimber pest attack.\nTo help minimise the risk of any future loss, the Client should consider whether the following options to further protect their\ninvestment against timber pest infestation are appropriate for their circumstances:\nUndertake thorough regular inspections at intervals not exceeding twelve months or more frequent inspections where the risk of\ntimber pest attack is high or the building type is susceptible to attack. To further reduce the risk of subterranean termite attack,\nimplement a management program in accordance with Australian Standard AS 3660. This may include the installation of a monitoring\nand/or baiting system, or chemical and/or physical barrier. However, AS 3660 stresses that subterranean termites can bridge or\nbreach barrier systems and inspection zones and that thorough regular inspections of the building are necessary.\nIf the Client has any queries or concerns regarding this Report, or the Client requires further information on a risk management\nprogram, please do not hesitate to contact the person who carried out this Inspection.\nSECTION H ADDITIONAL COMMENTS\nAdditional comments The following additional comments are noted\nPre-Purchase Standard Property & Timber Pest Report © Copyright Report Systems Australia Pty Ltd - amended and reproduced under copyright Licence 1310-c033\nSubmitted by: A1TEAM-001 @ 21:59:59 13/04/2023 Page 30\nSubmission ID: 13060102\nEnvironment friendly, paperless solution by www.formitize.com",
